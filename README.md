## Getting Started

`npm run dev` to run

## To do

Optimize ParkingSlot component, it should use the same mapping for Entries with the Slots store to isolate changes/avoid rerenders when parking/unparking a car.

EntriesStore better structure to avoid duplication

Fix CSS (instead of inlining all over the place because I got spoiled by Chakra UI)
